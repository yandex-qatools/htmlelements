Html Elements 1.9 – What's New?
===============================

While developing a new version of our framework we mainly worked on the drawbacks that were found by the members our 
community. We have fixed some architectural problems and a couple of bugs related to initialization of 
`List<Т extends HtmlElements>`.

And we've got a new contributors as well! Thanks a lot to [@lanwen](http://github.com/lanwen) for the great 
"WaitFor" matcher implementation. We'd also like to thank [@pazone](http://github.com/pazone) for the idea of the matcher 
which recursively checks that all inner elements of a block exsist on a page, though the pull-request is still unaccepted. 
We hope it will be included in the next release.

If you still haven't got your "thank you" from [Yandex QATools](https://github.com/yandex-qatools) team, feel free to send 
us your ideas and your code as well.

And now it's time for a more detailed review of the new features.

Default usage of AjaxElementLocator
-----------------------------------

[Issue #3](https://github.com/yandex-qatools/htmlelements/issues/3)

This is one of the main and most important features of this release. Now `AjaxElementLocator` will be used by default for 
initialization of elements instead of `DefaultElementLocator`. It allows to search element not immediately after its 
method call but after a time-out has expired (5 seconds by default). The name `Ajax...` explains its destination completely.

Ability to use your own ElementLocator
--------------------------------------

[Issue #4](https://github.com/yandex-qatools/htmlelements/issues/4)

We've also added the ability to use your own implementation of `Element Locator` for elements and page objects 
initialization:

    HtmlElementLoader.createHtmlElement(Class<T extends HtmlElement> clazz, CustomElementLocatorFactory locatorFactory)
    HtmlElementLoader.populateHtmlElement(HtmlElement htmlElement, CustomElementLocatorFactory locatorFactory)
    HtmlElementLoader.createPageObject(Class<T> clazz, CustomElementLocatorFactory locatorFactory)
    HtmlElementLoader.populatePageObject(Object page, CustomElementLocatorFactory locatorFactory)

"WaitFor" Matcher
-----------------

[Issue #10](https://github.com/yandex-qatools/htmlelements/pull/10)

When dealing with client-side JavaScript we need to use a lot of different time-outs in our tests.<br/> 
Suppose you need to check that when entering some search request on the [Yandex homepage](http://www.yandex.com) suggest 
appears. But sugest is loaded with the help of AJAX, so this check has to be made after a time-out.<br/>
To let you make such checks easy we've implemented "WaitFor" matcher. With its help you can decorate other matchers and 
make your checks after a time-out has expired. Here is an example of its usage:

    MainPage mainPage = new MainPage(driver);
    mainPage.getSearchArrow().getRequestInput().sendKeys(REQUEST);
    assertThat(mainPage.getSuggest(), withWaitFor(exists()));

In this case the exists() matcher will be executed every 30 ms (it's a default interval) until it'll return true or until
30000 ms time-out (it's a default time-out) will expire. In case this check will not pass you'll get the following message:

    Expected: While waiting [<30000L>] millis it should be: element existing on page
         but: element Suggest not existing on page
         
Of course, you can define your own time-out instead of the default one:

    int timeoutInMilliseconds = 10000; //10 seconds

    MainPage mainPage = new MainPage(driver);
    mainPage.getSearchArrow().getRequestInput().sendKeys(REQUEST);
    assertThat(mainPage.getSuggest(), withWaitFor(exists(), timeoutInMilliseconds));

And even the interval of decorated matcher execution:

    int timeoutInMilliseconds = 10000; //10 seconds
    int intervalInMilliseconds = 50; //50 milliseconds

    MainPage mainPage = new MainPage(driver);
    mainPage.getSearchArrow().getRequestInput().sendKeys(REQUEST);
    assertThat(mainPage.getSuggest(), withWaitFor(exists(), timeoutInMilliseconds, intervalInMilliseconds));

A really great matcher, isn't it?

List&lt;T extends HtmlElement&gt; initialization bugfix
-------------------------------------------------------

[Issue #17](https://github.com/yandex-qatools/htmlelements/issues/17)

In the previous version when initializing a list of HtmlElements (or list of TypifiedElements) list items had been compared
with each other due to a bad items naming algorithm. As the result, tests that use lists of HtmlElements worked quite slowly.
We've improved the list items naming algorithm and now it works fine.

TypifiedElements useful methods
-------------------------------

[Issue #15](https://github.com/yandex-qatools/htmlelements/issues/15)

Turned out that `isDisplayed()`, `isEnabled()`, `isSelected()` methods are pretty useful for all types of elements.
So we've added them to the base TypifiedElements class.

Checkbox implementation improvements
------------------------------------

[Issue #14](https://github.com/yandex-qatools/htmlelements/issues/14)

The typified elements concept is quite immature yet, but we'll work on it in the next release.<br/>
In previous version there was an architectural drawback in Checkbox implementation:

    public void select() {
        if (!getWrappedElement().isSelected()) {
            getWrappedElement().click();
        }
    }

    public void deselect() {
        if (getWrappedElement().isSelected()) {
            getWrappedElement().click();
        }
    }

    public boolean isSelected() {
        return getWrappedElement().isSelected();
    }

So if you wanted to override `isSelected()` method, you had had to override the rest methods as well. It was inconvenient, 
so we've improved the `select()` and  `deselect()` methods to use isSelected() method:

    public void select() {
        if (!isSelected()) {
            getWrappedElement().click();
        }
    }


HtmlElements All
----------------

[Issue #18](https://github.com/yandex-qatools/htmlelements/issues/18)

We've made a separate module which contains the latest versions of htmlelements-java and htmlelements-matchers modules.
So you can use only one dependency instead of two:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>ru.yandex.qatools.htmlelements</groupId>
        <artifactId>htmlelements-all</artifactId>
        <version>1.9</version>
    <dependency>

As before, you can use htmlelements-java or htmlelements-matchers module separately.

Selenium Version update
-----------------------

[Issue #9](https://github.com/yandex-qatools/htmlelements/issues/9)

Selenium version was upgraded to 2.29.0

Java version downgrade 
----------------------

[Issue #7](https://github.com/yandex-qatools/htmlelements/issues/7)

The previous version of our framework was built with the use of Java 1.7. But Java 1.6 is still widespread. 
We've built the new version with the use of Java 1.6 to provide the ability to use our framework with this version of 
Java.

That is all for the 1.9 version. But new features will be developed soon! And now it's time to go :)
